Nine plus a drop rounds it off to ten!	"Watch out for plump (#120). Here Heisig could have added a ""t"" and we would have had a much better keyword : rotund.

It means to block out what is nonessential in order to fix our <i>eye</i> on a <i>few</i> important matters. The kanji suggests picking up a <i>few</i> things and holding them before one's <i>eye</i> in order to <b>focus</b> on them better.			You focus by concentrating your eye on fewer objects.

Perhaps it is because deep down we cherish the belief that by nature people are basically tender and sensitive. Be that as it may, the Japanese character for <b>thick</b> depicts a <i>child</i> abandoned out on the wild <i>cliffs</i>, exposed to the heat of the <i>sun</i>, and thus doomed to develop a head and skin as <b>thick</b> as the parent who left it there.			In Sparta we throw our Children over a Cliff. Under the Sun, they fight other Children. In the end, if they survive, they sure have thick skin.

This latter, as we will see, is far more common.		The kanji for water is an abstract primitive itself, so unless one is willing to break down its etymological development, it should just simply be memorized by strokes; constructing a story is not necessarily useful unless it strongly denotes its shape (I find that Heisig´s story doesn´t do this).

The final 4 strokes (the element for <i>water</i>) are abbreviated to the three small drops that we learned earlier as the kanji for <i>little</i>.		White is a symbol of purety, so white water is pure water, the precise definition of spring water.	Perhaps the most common appearance of this kanji is in the word 温泉 (おんせん, onsen), a Japanese hot spring.

Don't bother looking it up in your English dictionary; it's a Japanese word for measuring distances. One <b><i>ri</i></b> is about 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles. The kanji depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the <i>rice field</i>, and below the element for <i>land</i>. Those four sections you see in the <i>rice field</i> (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in frame 14) are actually measurements of <i>land</i>, much the same as farm-sections in the United States have given us the notion of a ""country mile."" The <i>land</i> division based on the size of a <i>rice field</i> is called a <b><i>ri</i></b>."	* To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this kanji, we shall refer to it as a <i>computer</i>, a meaning deriving from the kanji for <i>logic</i>, which we will meet in Lesson 12.		The ri is a Japanese way of measuring the area of the GROUND underneath a RICE FIELD.	Hint: Heisig makes here a severe disservice to everyone by using a weird keyword for this character. You´ll save a lot (and I mean, a whole lot) of trouble later by giving it instead its intended meaning: House of the Parents.	2		リ	さと	郷里(きょうり): birth-place, home town	里 (さと)	"<img src=""091cc.svg"">"	JLPT_None Jouyou_2

Our ninja hero, disguised as a gardener with a rake, is suddenly attacked from both left and right concurrently by bulls with animal horns.

Its elements are: <i>reclining</i> . . . <i>floor</i> . . . <i>fishhook</i> . . . <i>sheaf</i>. Do not confuse with <i>spirits</i> (Frame 1930).			You´re reclining on the floor trying to hook a sheaf with a small hook through the cracks. That you´ve been doing this for seven hours without success shows your burning spirit.

Rather than the biblical image of tying a millstone about the victim's neck, here we see a <i>crown</i> tied about one <i>leg</i> before the unfortunate party is tossed into the <i>water</i>.			(thx geezer) The maimed waitress (no head and arms just her legs and trunk) is dropped into the water with a cement crown to make sure she sinks.

It shows a fellow in a <i>top hat</i> and <i>scarf</i>, trying hard to look happy by putting a <i>walking stick</i> in his <i>mouth</i> sideways to twist his face into a grotesque but semi permanent smile.			If you thought that the dude in 哀 was pathetic, you haven´t seen him after his decline. Here he is carrying a stick around in his mouth like a dog, begging people to throw it for him. Note that the mouth is closed only after the stick goes in, as is only logical.	If you thought that the dude in 哀 was pathetic, you haven´t seen him after his decline.

You can think of this character forming as a pair with that of the former frame: there the <i>in</i> (the <i>walking stick</i> in the <i>mouth</i>) was set on its side; here it is set upright.			The guy from pathetic (#401) shared his inmost feelings with a girl and she rammed a walking stick down his throat. It ruptured his inmost organs.

In the old west, animal skins were made into leather and their flesh was eaten, thus using the whole animal, which viewed from the animal side could be taken as humans asserting complete hegemony over them.

Following -て form of another verb, means ""to do the favor of"": 窓を開けて呉れませんか, ""Won't you open the window [do the favor of opening/kindly open the window]?"" Usu. written in hiragana."	I see this as a pictograph of an old-style phonograph - a stand, record, crank and bell (the mouth). Even the primitives work out - a tool with a crank which plays music out of the bell mouth.

The problem is what comes in between. It is formed by the character for <i>complete</i>, whose vertical stroke doubles up as the first stroke of <i>water</i>.			Think of a picture of someone steaming vegetables. On top you see the flowers of cauliflower or something else that is being steamed. Underneath, the pan is completely full of water. Below the pan is a floor - that's the hotplate - and under that the oven fire. Caution: don't confuse with boil (#1257), or the steam radical in spirit (#1885).

It seems that each of them knew how to make one part of the beast, so they pooled their talents and brought all the pieces (<i>diced</i> into pieces) together, at which point the fabricated <b><i>tiger</i></b> promptly ate its makers up (the bodiless <i>human legs</i>). Whatever the parable's significance for modern civilization and its arsenals, it should help with this kanji. Oh yes, we should not forget that cliff-like element. Think of it as an abbreviation of the primitive for <i>zoo</i> (the first and fourth strokes, actually), in order to fit the <b>tiger</b> somewhere into the picture. In fact, the abbreviation is perfectly logical, since the bottom elements usurp the room for the rest of the primitive for <i>zoo</i>.	* As a primitive element itself, the <i>human legs</i> are also swallowed up, but the meaning of <i>tiger</i> is kept, and the whole serves as a roof for what comes beneath 虍, giving the <i>tiger</i> something else to eat.
