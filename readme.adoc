== What's in the box?
* A ready-to-bake deck containing _almost_ all the information you could ever need to study Kanji. footnote:[Due to copyright issues, I cannot provide Heisig's Stories. You'll have to look for them on your own.]
* [red]##Flaring## card design. Inspired by Kanji Koohii, designed with https://github.com/Mauville/AnkiDroid-Card-Preview[AnkiDroid Card Preview]

* Scripts to migrate everything from Kanji Koohii to Anki.

IMPORTANT: I just discovered that you can toggle the Story, Details and Dict buttons without exiting the Whiteboard mode! You just need to tap and hold one finger anywhere in the screen while pressing the desired button with another. 

== Prework

.Do you know how to use Anki?
If not, you can start by watching  https://youtu.be/QS2G-k2hQyg?t=98[this video] on the basics on Anki.  You can also read the https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/[manual] if you get lost. +


== Instructions

=== Importing Keywords and Stories

. Download and extract the https://www.github.com/Mauville/Koohii2Anki/releases/latest/download/K2A.zip[latest release] of Koohii2Anki.
. https://kanji.koohii.com/study/mystories[Download] your stories and keywords from Kanji Koohii.
. Save the file to the `{card-import}` directory (it should be named `my_stories.csv`)
. Run `getstories`.
.. If you are using Windows, I've provided an exe for simplicity.
.. If you are using Linux or MacOS or you are comfortable with a terminal, you should follow the <<script-setup, extra steps>>

=== Styles, Stroke Order, Progress
. Import `SkeletonDeck.apkg` into Anki.
. Delete the demo card that comes included with it.
. Import `{output}` into Anki.
.. The import dialogue should look like this.
+
[.text-center]
image::import.png[auto, 350]
+
. Move `_jquery-3.7.1.min.js` into your https://docs.ankiweb.net/files.html[collection.media directory]

You should now have a new deck called Remembering the Kanji in Anki.

==== Stroke Order and Progress
. https://kanji.koohii.com/manage/export[Download] your progress from Kanji Koohii. 
. Download these addons: `1340694622 1947297285`. (https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1947297285[Source 1] https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1340694622[Source 2].)
. When the download has finished, restart Anki
. Click on menu:Tools[Kanji Colorizer for RTK] to generate stroke order diagrams.
+
NOTE: If you are using the 4th edition of the book, change the following plugin configuration files to reflect your version. You can do this in menu:Tools[Add-Ons], select the "Import Kanji Koohii Progress" addon and click on config.
+
. Click on menu:Tools[Import Kanji Koohii Progress] and select the `rtk_flashcards.csv` file you downloaded earlier.
+
NOTE: Anki can seemingly not respond while executing the plugins. This is normal. Give it some time.


Phew! That's it!  🎉🎉🎉🎉


== Miscellaneous

=== Finished RTK?
If you have already finished RTK or you are working on Core2K simultaneously, you should definitely look into https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1600796261[Kanji Vocab] an Add-on that links vocab with kanji.

=== Card Styles and Edition
The deck comes with predetermined styles for smartphones so if you have the 6th edition and you'll be reviewing on mobile, skip this part.

. Hit kbd:[B] and select the Remembering the Kanji deck on the left.
. Hit kbd:[Ctrl+L] or the btn:[Cards] button 

[NOTE]
====
If you are using the 4th edition of the book, you'll want to change the `Back Template` to reflect the edition. +
You should change the line `<li id="framenum">{{frameNoV6}}</li>` to `<li id="framenum">{{frameNoV4}}</li>`.
====

The `Styling` field's `font-size:` needs to be adjusted to adapt to screen size. +
Decide which device size you'll be using the most (from best to worst support):

.. If you choose a smartphone, you should choose a value of around `.45em` (default)
.. If you choose a tablet, you should choose a value of around `.4em`
.. If you choose a desktop computer, you should choose a value of around `.3em`
Experiment with the values to see what works for you

=== Script Setup
If you can't run the `getstories.exe` you can use the uncompiled Python version.

. https://www.python.org/downloads/[Install Python 3]
. Make sure that you are running Python 3 by running in a terminal
+

    python --version
+
and 
+

    pip --version
+
NOTE: If on any of these commands you get  `Python 2.x`, you should look into getting python 3 into your PATH.
+
. Install pandas.
+

    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pandas
+
. Run the script (remember cd'ing into the `{card-import}` directory) with:
+

    python getstories.py


=== Why?
Tl;dr Anki is better. 

* With Koohii Forums closing down on 2019, we got reminded that the Kanji Koohii depends on a man and a few contributors. If someday the site gets nuked, all the reviewing system and personal progress will be deleted too.

* The site's development is stalled. Although KK has been https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii[open sourced] some time ago, no major improvements have been done since. What's more, Fabrice, the main developer of the site, has publicly announced to have switched the site to maintenance mode.

* When I began my journey through Japanese, I was eager to go and jumped straight into RTK and KK. After completing RTK1, I began studying with Anki. My world was shook. It was so much better; plugins, card styling, better failed card handling, portability, configurable SRS, offline capabilities, FOSS. I decided that switching from KK to Anki was to be my next step.

* The portable reviewer for KK (Android) is not open source, hard to install and a bit dated. For those of you who don't know, http://slideme.org/application/kanji-ryokucha[Kanji Ryokucha] is an app that allows you to review RTK on the go. It has many advantages over the website such as stroke order and a scratchpad to write. Unfortunately, it is dependent on the internet to get the cards.
